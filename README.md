## Banking Environment | BlueJ
The project's objective is to apply Java's object-oriented programming principles to
develop a solution for a real-world problem. The specific focus is on designing and
implementing a parent class called "Bankcard" and two subclasses, namely "Debit card"
and "Credit card," to represent different types of bank cards. These classes will utilize
key object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and
abstraction. Additionally, the project will integrate important GUI elements by leveraging
classes from the javax.swing package, functions and features from the java.awt
package, event listeners, action events, and visually appealing design principles.

In the project, several tools are used to aid in its completion. These tools include BlueJ,
Microsoft Word, and Draw.io. BlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE)
used for writing and compiling Java code. It helps to clearly show the relationships
between different classes in the project.
